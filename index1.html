    <center><div class="notes" style="width: 900px;"> While the number of female leaders has more than doubled since 2005, a woman in power is hardly the norm around the world. Sixty-three of 142 nations studied by the World Economic Forum have had a female head of government or state at some point in the 50 years up to 2014, but in nearly two-thirds of those nations a woman was in power for less than four of the 50 years, including 11 countries (17%) where a woman led for less than a year.</div></center>
